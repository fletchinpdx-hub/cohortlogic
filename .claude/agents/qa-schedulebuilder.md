description: Post-deploy QA smoke test for the Cohort Logic Schedule Builder at cohortlogic.com/schedule-app.html. Run after every deploy to verify the live app works end-to-end. Especially valuable after the schedule-grid.js monolith split (v146–v149) — it exercises each of the extracted feature files (IA Schedule, Specials Schedule view, Class Schedules view, Export) in a real logged-in session, which the static reference checker can't. Reports pass/fail with screenshots. Part of the full QA suite — see the "QA process" section in CLAUDE.md; running "QA" runs this AND every other qa-*.md agent. Use this whenever the user says "run QA", "run schedule QA", "test the deploy", "smoke test", or "qa-schedulebuilder".

# QA Smoke Test — Cohort Logic Schedule Builder

You are running a post-deploy QA check on the live Schedule Builder at **https://cohortlogic.com/schedule-app.html**.

**Why this exists:** the ~6,200-line `schedule-grid.js` was split into feature files (`schedule-ia.js`, `schedule-specials-view.js`, `schedule-class-view.js`, `schedule-export.js`) loaded as separate classic `<script>` tags sharing one global scope. The failure mode of a bad split is an **`Uncaught ReferenceError: <name> is not defined`** the moment a view opens — a function that didn't get moved, or loaded out of order. The whole point of this QA is to open each view in a real session and catch exactly that. **Any `Uncaught ReferenceError` or CSP error when a view renders is a FAIL — report the exact missing name.**

Work through the checklist in order. After each step, check the browser console. If a step fails, screenshot it and keep going — report everything at the end.

---

## Setup

Load the chrome browser tools before starting:
```
ToolSearch: select:mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp,mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate,mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer,mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_page,mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_console_messages,mcp__claude-in-chrome__find,mcp__claude-in-chrome__javascript_tool
```

Read the QA credentials from `/Users/michaelfletcher/dev/cohortlogic/.qa-credentials` (`qa_email`, `qa_password`).

Open a fresh tab and navigate to `https://cohortlogic.com/login.html`.

## Checklist

### 1. Login + product gate + app boot
- Enter `qa_email` / `qa_password`, click **Sign in**
- **Pass:** redirects to `dashboard.html`
- Navigate to `https://cohortlogic.com/schedule-app.html`
- **Pass:** the Schedule Builder loads — sidebar shows School Info, Staff Roster, Specials, Block Types, Building Schedule, Specials Schedule, Class Schedules, IA Schedule, Export
- **Fail (prerequisite, not a code bug — flag it clearly):** an access-denied / locked screen means the QA account lacks `schedule_builder` in its school's `enabled_products`. Note this and stop — the rest can't run until the account is granted access.
- Run `read_console_messages` — any CSP error (`Refused to execute inline script`, `Content-Security-Policy`) or uncaught exception at boot is a **Fail**. A boot-time `ReferenceError` here would mean a script failed to load or a top-level `const` is used before its file — the split's worst case.
- **Shared Send Feedback widget** (`js/feedback.js`, on every product): confirm it injected and works. `JSON.stringify({ btn: !!document.getElementById('cf-fb-btn') })` → **Pass** if `btn:true`. Then `document.getElementById('cf-fb-btn').click(); JSON.stringify({ open: !document.getElementById('cf-fb-overlay').classList.contains('cf-fb-hidden') })` → **Pass** if `open:true`. Close it: `document.querySelector('.cf-fb-close').click();`. (The widget wires via addEventListener — if it were CSP-broken like the old inline-onclick version, the button would exist but not open.)

---

### 2. Seed a minimal schedule (so every view has something to render)

The detail views need a configured school. Rather than click through the whole setup wizard, inject a minimal valid state via JS, then let the app build the schedule. Run in `javascript_tool`:

```javascript
// Minimal school: 2 grades, 1 band, lunch+recess, a special, an IA, one required block.
SchedState.school = Object.assign(SchedState.school, {
  name: 'QA Test School', year: '2026-2027',
  grades: ['K','1'],
  gradeBands: [{ id: 'bandA', name: 'K-1', grades: ['K','1'] }],
  firstBell: '08:00', dismissal: '14:30', studentCampusStart: '07:45',
  lunchPeriods: [{ id: 'lp1', start: '11:00', duration: 30, grades: [] }],
  gradeRecesses: {
    K:   [{ id: 'rK', duration: 20, lunchAdjacent: true, lunchSide: 'after' }],
    '1': [{ id: 'r1', duration: 20, lunchAdjacent: true, lunchSide: 'after' }],
  },
  specials: [{ id: 'sp_pe', name: 'PE', duration: 40, classesPerWeek: 1, teacherIds: ['t_pe'], color: '#f97316' }],
  specialsRotationMode: 'intermittent',
  blockPairings: [], morningMeetings: [], altDays: [],
});
SchedState.staff = [
  { id: 'c_k', name: 'Ms. K',    role: 'classroom_teacher', gradeAssignment: 'K' },
  { id: 'c_1', name: 'Mr. One',  role: 'classroom_teacher', gradeAssignment: '1' },
  { id: 't_pe', name: 'Coach P', role: 'specials_teacher' },
  { id: 'ia_1', name: 'Aide Amy', role: 'ia', color: '#22c55e' },
];
// Keep the default fixed block types; add one required instructional block.
if (typeof ensureFixedBlockTypes === 'function') ensureFixedBlockTypes();
if (!SchedState.blockTypes.some(b => b.id === 'bt_ela')) {
  SchedState.blockTypes.push({
    id: 'bt_ela', name: 'ELA', color: '#3b82f6', category: 'instruction',
    required: true, bandMinutes: { bandA: 60 }, subBandMinutes: {}, subBlocks: [],
  });
}
SchedState.iaAllocations = [{ id: 'alloc1', name: 'Reading Support', color: '#22c55e', hoursPerDay: 6 }];
SchedState.iaSchedule = SchedState.iaSchedule || {};
saveToLocal();
'seeded: ' + SchedState.school.grades.join(',') + ' | staff ' + SchedState.staff.length;
```

- **Pass:** returns `"seeded: K,1 | staff 4"` with no thrown error
- **If it throws** (SchedState shape drifted since this was written): note it, then either fix the field it complained about or fall back to driving the setup UI (School Info → set name + grades K,1 + times → Save; Staff → add the 4 people above; Specials → add PE; Block Types → add band K-1 + a required ELA block). The goal is only a populated schedule so the views have data.

---

### 3. Building Schedule (core `schedule-grid.js`)
- Click **Building Schedule** in the sidebar (or `navigateTo('master'); renderMasterSchedule();` via JS)
- **Pass:** the grid table renders with grade columns (Kindergarten, 1st Grade), time rows, and auto-filled blocks (Lunch, Recess, ELA, Specials visible). The left palette lists block types.
- `read_console_messages` — **Fail** on any `Uncaught ReferenceError` / CSP error.
- Sanity-check the placement engine still runs: confirm at least one `bt_lunch` and one instructional block are present:
  `JSON.stringify(Object.values((SchedState.masterSchedule.Monday||{}).K||{}).filter((v,i,a)=>a.indexOf(v)===i))`
  — **Pass:** array includes `"bt_lunch"` and `"bt_ela"` (or `bt_spec`).

---

### 4. IA Schedule view (extracted → `schedule-ia.js`) — KEY SPLIT CHECK
- Click **IA Schedule** (or `navigateTo('ia'); renderIAScheduleView();`)
- **Pass:** the IA view renders — the "All IAs" grid or individual-IA grid shows, with the IA (Aide Amy) and the allocation (Reading Support) present. No `ReferenceError`.
- Toggle to the individual-IA tab if present; confirm it renders.
- Because this whole feature moved into a separate file, a missing helper (e.g. `buildIAGrid`, `_dutySlotsFor`, `openDutyPanel`) would throw here — report the exact name.

**IA Assignment tab — coverage plan + personal-time rows**
```
navigateTo('ia-assign'); renderIAAssignmentView();
JSON.stringify({
  rows: (SchedState.iaCoverage||[]).length,
  personal: (SchedState.iaCoverage||[]).filter(r=>r.kind).map(r=>r.kind),
  scopes: [...new Set((SchedState.iaCoverage||[]).filter(r=>!r.kind).map(r=>r.scope))]
})
```
- **Pass:** `personal` contains BOTH `ia_lunch` and `ia_breaks` (seeded by `_ensureIAPersonalRows` and reorderable like any row). No `ReferenceError`.

**Place IAs actually places**
```
const rep = placeIAs(); JSON.stringify({ placedHrs:+(rep.placed/60).toFixed(1), shortfalls:rep.shortfalls.length, inconsistencies:rep.inconsistencies.length, budgets:(rep.budget||[]).length })
```
- **Pass:** `placedHrs > 0` and no throw. Shortfalls/inconsistencies may be non-zero on a
  thin seeded schedule — note them, don't fail on them.
- **Fail:** a throw, or `placedHrs` is 0 while the coverage plan has rows with grades.

**Duty consistency + personal time land the same each day** (the two rules most likely to regress)
```
const D=['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday'];
const starts={}; D.forEach(d=>Object.entries(SchedState.iaSchedule[d]||{}).forEach(([id,sl])=>{
  const s=Object.keys(sl).filter(k=>sl[k].targetType==='own_lunch').sort()[0]; if(s)(starts[id]=starts[id]||[]).push(s);}));
JSON.stringify(Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(starts).map(([id,v])=>[id,[...new Set(v)]])))
```
- **Pass:** each aide's own-lunch start list collapses to ONE time (same clock time every day).
- **Fail:** an aide shows two different start times → `reservePersonalTime` regressed.

**Assign IAs from the Building Schedule** (palette tool + popover)
```
navigateTo('master'); renderMasterSchedule();
JSON.stringify({ tool: !!document.getElementById('palette-assign-ia'), fn: typeof openMasterIAAssign })
```
- **Pass:** `tool:true` and `fn:"function"`. Click the tool, then click a filled block —
  the popover opens listing aides with Free / Busy / Outside-hours states.
- **Fail:** missing tool or `fn:"undefined"` (schedule-ia.js didn't load / regressed).

---

### 5. Specials Schedule view (extracted → `schedule-specials-view.js`) — KEY SPLIT CHECK
- Click **Specials Schedule** (or `navigateTo('specials-sched'); renderSpecialsScheduleView();`)
- **Pass:** the by-teacher weekly grid renders; the Coverage panel is present; Coach P appears as a specials teacher. No `ReferenceError`.
- Click a filled specials cell (or confirm `openSpecialsOverridePanel` is defined: `typeof openSpecialsOverridePanel`) — the override panel should be reachable.
- `read_console_messages` — **Fail** on any error. A missing `getSpecialsCoverageReport` / `buildSpecialsTeacherGrid` / `showSpecialsCoverageBanner` would surface here.
- **Note:** the specials scheduling *algorithm* (`buildSpecialsSchedule`) stayed in core — if THAT is missing the Building Schedule (step 3) would already have failed.

---

### 6. Class Schedules view (extracted → `schedule-class-view.js`) — KEY SPLIT CHECK
- Click **Class Schedules** (or `navigateTo('class-sched'); renderClassSchedulesView();`)
- **Pass:** renders the single-class view; switching to grade-compare renders too. No `ReferenceError`.
- Confirm the helpers resolve: `[typeof getClassSlotEntry, typeof buildClassWeekGrid, typeof buildGradeCompareGrid, typeof classSchedUI]` — none should be `"undefined"`.
- `read_console_messages` — **Fail** on any error.

---

### 7. Export (extracted → `schedule-export.js`) — KEY SPLIT CHECK
- Click **Export** (or `navigateTo('export'); renderExportPlaceholder();`)
- **Pass:** the Export view renders with the download/export buttons.
- Confirm the export functions resolve: `[typeof exportXLSX, typeof exportJSON, typeof _blendColumnRuns]` — none `"undefined"`.
- Trigger the JSON export (safe, no multi-sheet complexity): `exportJSON();` — **Pass:** a download starts / no error thrown. (Optionally `exportXLSX();` — it opens SheetJS; a thrown error is a Fail, a download is a Pass.)
- `read_console_messages` — **Fail** on any error.

---

### 8. Synchronized Blocks — same-block non-overlap rule (v150)

Two paired groups for the **same** block must land at **non-overlapping** times (a shared intervention specialist can't cover both at once); two groups for **different** blocks may overlap. This step sets up both cases and checks placement.

Run in `javascript_tool` to configure 4 grades in 2 bands, a WIN block paired two ways (2/3 and 4/5), and a Math block paired the other two (to prove different blocks are allowed to coincide), then force a fresh rebuild:

```javascript
SchedState.school.grades = ['2','3','4','5'];
SchedState.school.gradeBands = [
  { id: 'b23', name: '2-3', grades: ['2','3'] },
  { id: 'b45', name: '4-5', grades: ['4','5'] },
];
SchedState.school.gradeRecesses = {};              // keep the day open so WIN fits
if (typeof ensureFixedBlockTypes === 'function') ensureFixedBlockTypes();
const upsert = (id, name, color, cat, mins) => {
  let b = SchedState.blockTypes.find(x => x.id === id);
  if (!b) { b = { id, name, color, category: cat, required: true, subBandMinutes: {}, subBlocks: [] }; SchedState.blockTypes.push(b); }
  b.required = true; b.bandMinutes = mins;
};
upsert('bt_win',  'WIN',  '#22c55e', 'intervention', { b23: 30, b45: 30 });
upsert('bt_math', 'Math', '#a855f7', 'instruction',  { b23: 30, b45: 30 });
SchedState.school.blockPairings = [
  { id: 'win23',  blockId: 'bt_win',  subId: null, grades: ['2','3'] },
  { id: 'win45',  blockId: 'bt_win',  subId: null, grades: ['4','5'] },
  { id: 'math23', blockId: 'bt_math', subId: null, grades: ['2','3'] },
  { id: 'math45', blockId: 'bt_math', subId: null, grades: ['4','5'] },
];
SchedState.specialsSchedule = {};   // force a fresh full rebuild so pairings place cleanly
saveToLocal();
navigateTo('master'); renderMasterSchedule();
'pairing test configured';
```

Then read back the placed start times:

```javascript
const t2m = s => { const [h,m] = s.split(':').map(Number); return h*60+m; };
const startOf = (grade, unit) => {
  const sched = (SchedState.masterSchedule.Monday || {})[grade] || {};
  const keys = Object.keys(sched).filter(k => sched[k] === unit).sort();
  return keys[0] || null;
};
const win = { g2: startOf('2','bt_win'),  g3: startOf('3','bt_win'),  g4: startOf('4','bt_win'),  g5: startOf('5','bt_win') };
const math = { g2: startOf('2','bt_math'), g4: startOf('4','bt_math') };
const winA = win.g2, winB = win.g4;
const nonOverlap = (winA && winB) ? Math.abs(t2m(winA) - t2m(winB)) >= 30 : false; // both 30-min blocks
JSON.stringify({ win, math, winGroupsDiffer: winA !== winB, winNonOverlap: nonOverlap, mathMayCoincide: math.g2 && math.g4 });
```

- **Pass — all of:**
  - `win.g2 === win.g3` and `win.g4 === win.g5` (each group is internally synced)
  - `winGroupsDiffer` is `true` (the two WIN groups are at **different** times)
  - `winNonOverlap` is `true` (≥ 30 min apart — the windows don't overlap)
  - `mathMayCoincide` is truthy (the Math groups placed; they're **allowed** to share a time — different block)
- **Fail:** the two WIN groups share a start, or their windows overlap (< 30 min apart), or a `ReferenceError` (`placePairedBlocks`, `_findPairingTimes`, `_pairingCurrentTimes` not defined — a split/deploy regression)
- Then check the warnings panel: `document.getElementById('pairing-banner')?.textContent || 'no pairing warning'`. With this setup there's plenty of room, so **Pass = no pairing-overlap warning**. (If the day were too tight, a warning here would be correct behavior, not a bug — note it rather than failing.)
- `read_console_messages` — **Fail** on any error.
- **Cleanup (so it doesn't bleed into the console step):** `SchedState.school.blockPairings = []; saveToLocal();`

---

### 9. Final console check
- `read_console_messages` with pattern `error|Error|CSP|Content-Security|Refused|Uncaught|is not defined`
- Any `Content-Security-Policy` error → **Fail** (exact message).
- Any `Uncaught ReferenceError`/`TypeError` → **Fail** — for a `ReferenceError`, the missing name tells you exactly which function didn't get moved or which file loaded out of order.
- Warnings are OK to note, not failures.

---

## Pre-deploy static checks (run locally before deploying)

The gate already covers this, but for reference — before deploying, `bash scripts/predeploy.sh` runs all 5 checks including `tests/check-refs.js`, which catches a missing cross-file reference statically. This live QA is the runtime complement: it catches things a static check can't (load order, a handler that throws only when its view actually renders).

---

## Log the run

After all steps, append one line to `/Users/michaelfletcher/dev/cohortlogic/qa-runs.log` (gitignored):

```bash
printf '%s | %s | %s | %s\n' "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')" "schedulebuilder" "RESULT" "NOTES" >> /Users/michaelfletcher/dev/cohortlogic/qa-runs.log
```

`RESULT` like `8/9 PASS`, `NOTES` a short summary (or `all green`). Always write it.
